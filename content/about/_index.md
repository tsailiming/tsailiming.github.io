Hello! I'm Liming. Welcome to my personal 404 articles. Opinions expressed herewith are strictly mine and have nothing to do with my past and current employer.

I've worked as a software engineer, specialising in various fields such as High Performance Computing and Big Data, before moving to engineering management. For the last twenty years, I have been leading teams to build successful products and solutions.

I co-founded Activfy and began to fully understand the the sweat, laugh and tears that accompany every one that embarks on this journey of building a travel startup.

Currently, I work at Red Hat as an AI Architect for APAC.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to connect with me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tsailiming) or [X](https://x.com/tsailiming).
